# 16 - More on numbers and Strings

## Integers

JavaScript has imprecisions when working with numbers, they come from the translation from binary system to decimal.
In general they are present on decimal numbers, and the rounding engine is pretty smart to spot those imprecisions. However, there are some works around in order to avoid problems.

`Math` is an object which includes many useful calculations.

## Strings

Regular Expressions ("RegEx").
