# 31 Testing

## What is testing?

In programming this will mean creating a code which does not require us to manually execute the test and look for errors or the expected result.

Types of test:
- Unit Test: Used on fully isolated parts of the code (a function, class, etc)
- Integration Test: Integration of a feature into another feature, dependencies. (Testing a function that calls another function)
- End to End (E2E): Full flow of the application.

## Testing Tools

- Test runner: Executes tests and summarizes results. (Mocha, Jest)
- Assertion Library: Defines testing logic conditions. (Chai, Jest)
- Headless browser: Simulates browser interaction (Puppeteer)
