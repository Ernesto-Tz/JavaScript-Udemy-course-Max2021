# HTTP requests

When a http request is sent to load a website what files are sent by the server?
The application is hosted on the server and running there, then what files are get by the browser?

What happens is that the browser sends a request to the server, the first file to arrived will be the html file, then the CSS and at the end probably the JavaScript file. The browser is in charge of interpret and display all the information included. On the metadata of the request we can find which type of file it is getting (pdf, html, etc).

Routes or also called entry points from an application.

## How to send a new HTTP request

It starts by creating a new XML Http request object, it is supported by all browsers. This object allows us to create the request.

Then we need to configure the request:
1. Call the open method from the `XMLHttp` object. It is only the first step, no network activity is started.
2. Define `.open()` arguments; first is the type of request (GET, POST, etc.), second is the url.
3. Send the request


```JavaScript
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhr.open('GET','https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');

xhr.send();
```

The information get on the response is in a JSON format most of the time, however, we can't modify that data unless we parse it. For that we have 2 options:

* Manually parse the response using `JSON.parse()`
* Set the response type to JSON.

```Javascript
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhr.open('GET','https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');

// Version 1
const listOfPosts = JSON.parse(xhr.response);
console.log(listOfPosts);

// Version 2
xhr.responseType = 'json';
const listOfPosts2 = xhr.response;
console.log(listOfPosts2);

xhr.send();
```

> we have to define the type of response specifically as `'json'`. Manual parsing is widely supported.
## Debugging request

We can open developer tools and on the network tab we can see all the requests generated by the application. First we will probably see the `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js` and then we can see other request such as `GET` request and see the content, header, etc.
